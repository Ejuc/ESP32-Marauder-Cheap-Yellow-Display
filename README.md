## ðŸŒŸ Update Highlights 03/17/24 ðŸŒŸ

- **Version 0.13.9 added to the CYM web flasher, will push files needed to compile from source soon** 

- **Added builds without GPS to the web flasher to allow for serial CLI access to the CYM.**
    
- **Unrelated to the 0.13.9 release: SwiftPair Spam now 100% functional** Samsung, Google, and BLE spam will still crash on occasion but definitely an improvement and usable now. Waiting 10 seconds before each scan seems to help also.

## Web Flasher Instructions
- **Visit:** [CYM-Web-Flasher](https://fr4nkfletcher.github.io/ESP32-Marauder-Cheap-Yellow-Display/flash0.html)

- **Choose your hardware** and click **Connect** to start the flashing process.

## Compatibility

Successfully tested on both of these available on Amazon:
- [Module 1](https://amazon.com/dp/B0BVFXR313)
- [Module 2](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CLR7MQ91)

No hardware modifications required thanks to integration with **@ggaljoen's** [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/ggaljoen/TFT_eSPI) fork.

- **GPS Functionality**: ðŸ›° GPS is [enabled](screenshots/gps5.jpg) and fully operational through the 4-pin connector located near the MicroUSB port of the CYD module. [Check here](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/gps-modification) for details on supported GPS hardware.

## Setup

Add necessary libraries to your Arduino libraries folder. Configure your Arduino environment as detailed in the [ESP32 Marauder Arduino IDE Setup Guide](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/arduino-ide-setup).

Ensure the upload speed is set to `115200` in Arduino IDE (tested with version 1.8.19).

**If you're having issues or want to do everything yourself, [check Smoochiee's tutorial](https://github.com/smoochiee/MARAUDER-FOR-CYD---CHEAP-YELLOW-DISPLAY) for an in-depth walkthrough of the port.**
